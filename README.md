This project demonstrates how to integrate Amazon S3 with a Spring Boot application for uploading and storing files.
The project includes a REST API for uploading files to an AWS S3 bucket, retrieving stored files, and deleting files.
It leverages AWS SDK to interact with the S3 service and provides endpoints for users to interact with the storage.
